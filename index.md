## Juan Pablo Sandoval Alcocer

Since August 2017, I am part-time professor at the UPB (Universidad Privada Bolivia) and UMSS(Universidad Mayor de San Simon). I founded SemanTics S.R.L, a company that offers specific tools for Software analysis. I am member of the Pharo community.

My research interests lie in software engineering, more specifically in the fields of software maintenance, mining software repositories, software performance and software visualization. I currently follow two main research tracks: 1) mining static and dynamic information of source code repositories to understand and improve different aspects of the development process and 2) discover approaches, techniques, and tools to improve the way that we build and maintain software. I have additional interests in empirical software engineering and programming languages.

My publications may be found on the common online resources (Google Scholar and DBLP).
